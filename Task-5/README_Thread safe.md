 """"""""""  Lock-Free Thread-Safe Smart Pointer  """""""""""

This README of the thread-safe code to explain the problem it solves, how its atomic operations work, and how it produces its output.

1. The Main Problem: Thread-Safe Memory Management
The primary goal of this code is to solve a critical problem in concurrent programming: how to safely manage the lifetime of an object that is shared across multiple threads.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A std::shared_ptr does this using a reference count. When the count drops to zero, the object is deleted. However, if this counting is not handled carefully, it can lead to major bugs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\

#1: The Race Condition on a Non-Atomic Counter

  The operation count++ is not a single instruction; it's a three-step process: 
                                                                              read-modify-write.

***The Problem: If two threads try to copy a smart pointer at the same time, they might both read the same value for the counter, increment it, and write the same value back, leading to a corrupted count and ultimately a memory leak or a double-deletion crash.*****

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
 #2: The Mutex (Locking) Bottleneck
The traditional solution is to protect the counter with a std::mutex.

The Problem: While safe, this is slow. Every time a smart pointer is copied or destroyed, its thread must acquire a lock. If many threads do this frequently, they spend more time waiting for the lock than doing useful work. The lock becomes a bottleneck.

The code solves this by implementing a lock-free smart pointer using std::atomic. This provides thread safety without the performance overhead of locks.
\---------------------------------------------------------\
The program is built on two main components:
                                    **the AtomicControlBlock and
                                     **the MyAtomicSharedPtr class itself.

*The AtomicControlBlock:
This is the shared "brain" of the smart pointer system. It's a small object allocated on the heap that holds the shared state.

std::atomic<long> ref_count;: The most critical part. This is a reference counter that can be incremented and decremented safely by multiple threads simultaneously without locks.

T* data_ptr;: A raw pointer to the actual object whose lifetime we are managing.

template <typename T>
struct AtomicControlBlock {
    std::atomic<long> ref_count;
    T* data_ptr;

    // When the control block is finally deleted, it also deletes the data.
    ~AtomicControlBlock() { delete data_ptr; }
};



   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*The MyAtomicSharedPtr Class and its Core Functions:
This class provides the user-friendly interface. Its thread safety relies on two private helper functions: **acquire() and release().**

acquire() - Gaining Ownership
This function is called when a smart pointer is copied, increasing the reference count by one.

Action: Atomically increments the ref_count.

Code:

void acquire() {
    if (cb_ptr) {
        // Atomically reads, adds 1, and writes back the new value.
        // Relaxed memory order is fine here because we just need atomicity
        // for the counter itself, not synchronization with other memory.
        cb_ptr->ref_count.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
}



// Action: ptr2 is created as a copy of ptr1. acquire() is called.
// fetch_add(1) is executed on the ref_count.

// After: Both point to the same Control Block, ref_count is 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
release() - Relinquishing Ownership
This is the most critical function. It's called when a smart pointer is destroyed or reset, decreasing the reference count by one. If the count reaches zero, it cleans up the memory.

Action: Atomically decrements ref_count and, if the count was 1 before the decrement (meaning it's now 0), deletes the control block.

Code:

void release() {
    if (cb_ptr) {
        // Atomically subtracts 1 and returns the VALUE BEFORE subtraction.
        long old_count = cb_ptr->ref_count.fetch_sub(1, std::memory_order_acq_rel);

        // If the old count was 1, we were the last owner.
        if (old_count == 1) {
            // Deleting the control block also deletes the managed data.
            delete cb_ptr;
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why std::memory_order_acq_rel? :This is crucial. It creates a memory barrier that prevents compiler/CPU reordering. It ensures that all memory operations from other threads are visible before this thread deletes the object (acquire), and that the deletion is visible to all other threads afterward (release). This prevents very subtle bugs in concurrent code.


// Action: ptr2 goes out of scope. release() is called.
// fetch_sub(1) is executed. It returns the old_count (2). 2 != 1, so no deletion.

// After: ref_count is 1.


 ptr1 is destroyed (Final Deletion):

// Action: ptr1 goes out of scope. release() is called.
// fetch_sub(1) is executed. It returns the old_count (1).
// The condition "if (old_count == 1)" is TRUE!

// Deletion occurs.
delete cb_ptr; // This also triggers "delete data_ptr" via the destructor.

3. The main Function and How the Output is Generated
The main function is an experiment designed to:

Verify the correctness of the pointer in a single thread.

Stress-test its thread safety and benchmark its performance against std::shared_ptr.

The Multi-threaded Stress Test
Setup: A number of threads (e.g., 8) are created. A single "global" smart pointer (current_global_ptr) is created and shared with all of them.

Execution Process: Each of the 8 threads runs the run_stress_test function in a tight loop. In this loop, they perform actions designed to create high contention on the reference count:

SmartPtrType temp_ptr = global_shared_ptr;: A thread makes a copy. This calls acquire().

The temp_ptr is immediately destroyed at the end of its scope. This calls release().

global_shared_ptr.reset(...): Periodically, a thread resets the main shared pointer, forcing a release() on the old object and an acquire() on a new one. This creates intense contention on the deletion and creation paths.

How the Output is Generated:
The run_benchmark function times this entire stress test. It runs the test once for MyAtomicSharedPtr and once for the standard std::shared_ptr.

Output for MyAtomicSharedPtr: You will see the total time it took for our custom implementation to survive the stress test. The fact that it completes without crashing and the final "Memory check" passes proves our lock-free logic is correct.

Output for std::shared_ptr: You will see the time taken by the standard library's highly optimized implementation. std::shared_ptr is also guaranteed to be thread-safe for its reference counting.

Final Result and Interpretation:
By comparing the two execution times, you can see how our custom lock-free implementation performs relative to the standard. Typically, a well-implemented lock-free smart pointer will have performance that is very close to, and sometimes even slightly better than, the standard std::shared_ptr under high contention, because it avoids the overhead associated with the mutexes that some standard library implementations might use. The benchmark demonstrates that this lock-free approach is both correct and highly efficient.
