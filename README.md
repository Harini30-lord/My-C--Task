# C++ Programming Tasks

A collection of C++ tasks and assignments designed to practice various programming concepts.

## About This Repository

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming tasks completed in C++. Each task is organized into its own folder and focuses on a specific topic, such as data structures, algorithms, or language features.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need a C++ compiler installed on your machine. The most common one is `g++`.

* To check if you have `g++` installed, open your terminal and type:
    ```sh
    g++ --version
    ```

### Building and Running the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific task folder:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name/Task-1
    ```

3.  **Compile the C++ file:**
    Use the `g++` compiler to create an executable file. Replace `source_file.cpp` with the actual name of the C++ file in the folder.
    ```sh
    g++ source_file.cpp -o program
    ```

4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    ./program
    ```

5. Online Compiler:
